This is a profile form for a senior project I am working on with a group. 

More information about a senior project I worked on with a group can be found here https://github.com/SeniorProj19/FacialRecognition 

with a design doc here https://docs.google.com/document/d/15VaMyg3rmXDqF51Q3g-L78p0hp_JyaClo4qxOs9_lBM/edit?usp=sharing. 

This form will handle all the information a user will input and send it to a database where it can process within a mobile appliation that communicates with the Google Glass facial recognition. NOTE: This is the front-end portion of the profile form/website.
The site does not run through github because the whole part of the backend is not implemented in this section. Since I am not running the program, pictures of each part of the form are provided in the folders section.
