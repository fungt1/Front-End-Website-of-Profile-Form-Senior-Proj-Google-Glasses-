This is a profile form for a senior project I am working on with a group. This form will handle all the information a user will input and send it to a database where it can process within a mobile appliation that communicates with the Google Glass facial recognition. NOTE: This was created from my localhost so if you wanted to try it yourself you are going to need to put it on your own localhost in your computer. All my personal locahost information were taken out from the code as well.

The site does not run through github because the whole part of the backend is not implemented in this section. Since I am not running the program, pictures of each part of the form are provided in the folders section.
